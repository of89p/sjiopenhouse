        <p>
            The Josephian Formation Journey is the means through which our teachers accompany our students in their growth as a Josephian. The framework of the Josephian Formation Journey takes reference from that of the MOE Character and Citizenship Education curriculum. Lessons in the Josephian Formation Journey curriculum falls into three themes – Identity, Choices and Relationship.
            <br><br>
            The Identity lessons assist our students to develop their personhood – self-awareness, self-management, discovering aspirations.
            <br><br>
            The Choices lessons develop the personhood of our students to be one of responsibility and good moral standing. Through the Choices lessons, our students learn skills of reflectiveness so as to be able to exercise responsible and moral choices and thereby grow to become principled people. Through these lessons, they also learn goal-setting skills to support them to direct their growth and educational aspirations and thus be driven by faith and driven by passion.
            <br><br>
            As our students do not live in a vacuum but in community with others, the Relationship lessons develop them to become persons for others. They develop social awareness, civic-consciousness and relationship management. Thus, they become people-centred individuals who are also community-builders.

                In SJI, to LEAD means to SERVE. Student leaders are developed to know how to share their vision, enable their team members, be responsive to changes, be values-centred and always be encouraging to those whom they lead and work with.
                <br><br>
                We recognize that every student has the potential to lead. The school provides a wide range of opportunities for our students to exercise leadership.
                <br><br>
                Our students are provided with training during the different academic years to enable them to be effective in their leadership role.
                <br><br>
                Every student is expected to be an agent for the transmission of the Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community to his/her fellow Josephians. They are encouraged to serve and lead others to add value to our school community, society, their friends and families and ourselves. They take a holistic approach to work, promotes a sense of community and share responsibility in decision-making.</p>
