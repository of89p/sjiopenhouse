                    CAS enables students to enhance their personal and interpersonal development as well as their social and civic development, through experiential learning in the following three strands: creative, activity and service. CAS experiences should be both challenging and enjoyable - a personal journey of self-discovery that recognizes each student's individual starting point. These experiences are:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>real, purposeful activities, with significant outcomes</li>
                        <li>tasks that extend the student and be achievable in scope</li>
                        <li>thoughtfully considered involving planning, reviewing progress and reporting</li>
                        <li>reflected upon focusing on outcomes and personal learning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Students must demonstrate satisfactory participation in CAS for the award of the IB Diploma. This is achieved through the student’s active and balanced engagement in the experiences that encompass the three strands: creativity, action and service, and through their reflections. that indicate they have fulfilled the seven CAS learning outcomes.

                                In the Astronomy Club, we focus on expanding our knowledge about the vast cosmos. We do so by coming together and collaborating with one another, discussing concepts and findings. Typical sessions include presentations and quizzes to deepen our members’ understanding of astronomy. On special occasions, we would invite external speakers to address us, exposing us to more knowledge about the physical universe and celestial objects. We also hold stargazing sessions at Singapore Botanic Gardens in the evening during which we apply skills that we have learnt.

Members are able to wholeheartedly enjoy creating music while working together with their peers in bringing a musical arrangement to live. During the COVID-19 period, practices were conducted online through zoom meetings each week, allowing members to continue practicing their instruments and improving their technique and skills.

                                The Society of International and Current Affairs focuses on discussing international issues and broadening members' global perspectives. We undergo training and participate in various Model United Nations (MUN) conferences where students act as a delegate for a country and gather in a council to discuss solutions for a global issue. The aim of a MUN is to develop universally acceptable proposals to solve some of the pressing global issues including poverty, health, energy and education, conflict, wildlife and conservation, climate change and imbalanced trade, among others.

Through Ukulele, we learn many different skills that help nurture us as a Josephian. Although 2021 had led us to move learning online, it did not stop us from continuing with our ukulele sessions. We used zoom as our main platform to resume practice with each member learning new chords and songs. Despite the challenges, we still enjoyed learning the ukulele together.

No prior art experience is necessary to join the Visual Arts Club.

Most of our members have not tried any forms of art before and this is completely fine! Most students learn and pickup new skills along the way.

We better ourselves by pushing each other at training, and more importantly, encouraging each other to exceed our limits each time. Every Tuesday and Thursday, is a time in which we come together to play our game. Despite the limitations of COVID-19, we managed to adapt with the five-a-side rule and focus less on a full court game but rather concentrated on honing individual skills.

Hence, Dance provides a safe environment for all to fully express themselves, challenging individuals to step out of their comfort zone. You will likely find yourself emerging as a more confident and creative dancer, ready to explore various types of choreography.

                                Even though hockey might not be the most popular sport in Singapore, it is a fun and engaging sport that many boys in SJI enjoy. Hockey places emphasis on both skills and teamwork, creating close knit teams year after year. Despite the COVID-19 virus, training was still carried out in groups of five outdoors, and sometimes even online on platforms such as zoom. If you would like to try something new, come join hockey!

                                Kin-Ball is an activity that introduces students to a relatively new sport in Singapore, as the Kin-Ball Association of Singapore was only founded in 2014. The distinctive feature of Kin-Ball is its large ball that measures 1.2m in diameter. Through Kin-Ball, students are able to cultivate teamwork, group-think, and strategic execution. The obstacles posed by Covid-19 allowed us to provide more focus on individual skills that each player can use to contribute in a game. We concentrated on drill-based practices and techniques that ensured players could continue to hone their skills in the game post pandemic.

                                Ultimate Frisbee is a sport that encompasses and emphasises teamwork and coordination. The seeming simplicity of throwing a frisbee belies the need for physical endurance, mental ability and sheer tenacity. Throughout 2020 due to the Phase 2 pandemic parameters, many opportunities to train together as a team were forfeited. Nonetheless, we made the best of the few training sessions that we had when restrictions were eased to hone our skills.

Our hope is that we can raise the spirits of the elderly. Due to the pandemic, we have shifted online to cater to the patients. We planned and conducted various activities on zoom, ranging from karaoke, workouts to percussion classes. Although it does prove more challenging to engage with the elderly remotely, through our many interactions from our respective computer screens, we are able to still show that we care for them, albeit not in person.

Our main programme is Lasallian Mentoring, where members coach Primary 1-6 mentees in English and Mathematics, as well as help with their homework or revision. In addition, we provide them with guidance, moral support and care. Due to social distancing regulations during the pandemic, we switched to Zoom using breakout rooms for one-to-one interaction with the children. While mentoring can be challenging at times, it is rewarding to have the opportunity to bond with the children. We hope that you will consider joining us!

Today, the club has over 60 members all of whom are either involved in entrepreneurship competitions or implementing innovative fundraising events for selected voluntary welfare organisations. The club has consistently won several key competitions including the Raffles Business Symposium, Social Innovation Relay, Citi-Youth For Causes and Youth Innovation Challenge over the period 2015-2021.

Partnering with Saint Andrew's Care Home, we planned a variety of projects throughout 2020 and 2021. We started out with Project Enliven, a two-part project to enrich the lives of the elderly who were stuck in their care homes due to COVID-19. This and other projects provided us with a chance to take the elderly down memory lane as we compared some of these attractions with how they appeared in the past.

                                Team Nila embodies both the service and activity strands in the many events that are mostly organized by ActiveSG and Team Nila. Members mainly volunteer in sporting activities. As most of these opportunities require students to be physically present at a venue to help out, many of them planned for 2020 and 2021 were derailed due to the COVID-19 restrictions. Despite facing difficulties conducting our usual activities aimed at helping the community through sports online, we still tried to make the best out of our situation with our cooperative and enthusiastic members. A few of the online activities include mass workouts and even a full programme lasting a few weeks of training where students interacted with seniors from the Fei Yue Community Centre through breakout sessions on a massive zoom call.

                                YoungXHush is a Creativity and Service CAS with the aim of championing mental health through the use of sign language. In line with our mother organization, Hush TeaBar, we aim to provide a safe and silent space here in SJI, organising fortnightly CAS sessions where we discuss topics pertaining to mental health as well as learn basic sign language. During the pandemic, we continued to hold sessions over Zoom, engaging with Hush TeaBar when possible to learn more about our cause. In this time, we also planned and organized events to raise awareness of mental health, especially in a school setting.

            <p>
                In SJI, to LEAD means to SERVE. Student leaders are developed to know how to share their vision, enable their team members, be responsive to changes, be values-centred and always be encouraging to those whom they lead and work with.
                <br><br>
                We recognize that every student has the potential to lead. The school provides a wide range of opportunities for our students to exercise leadership.
                <br><br>
                Our students are provided with training during the different academic years to enable them to be effective in their leadership role.
                <br><br>
                Every student is expected to be an agent for the transmission of the Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community to his/her fellow Josephians. They are encouraged to serve and lead others to add value to our school community, society, their friends and families and ourselves. They take a holistic approach to work, promotes a sense of community and share responsibility in decision-making.</p>

            <h3>DSA-Leadership Programme</h3>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>
                St John Baptist de La Salle, the founder of the Lasallian schools, renounced his wealth and status to devote himself to setting up schools that provide the poor with access to education. He believed that with education, the poor might have lives of dignity and freedom; it gave hope and opportunity for the common good.
                <br><br>
                It is from this tradition that SJI has borne leaders who contribute to the common good. Our alumni serve in fields ranging from academia to business and the cultural arts; in social, religious and political domains.
                <br><br>
                In the same spirit, the DSA leadership programme aims to raise national (civil and political) and community (civic) leaders who serve for the common good.
                <br><br>
                Through the DSA-Leadership programme, the boy develops an awareness of self, maturing through reflection, and consequently being able to lead himself and others. A Josephian leader is a community builder who is people-centred. An effective leader is one who has to learn how to motivate and work with a team to serve the community.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, the Josephian grows to become a servant leader for the common good. Students in this programme are expected to serve above and beyond others. This requires one to balance academic and CCA demands as well. At upper secondary, these boys will have opportunities to go out and gain leadership exposure through various community platforms. Time will be a precious resource that they need to manage well. The boys will be equipped with skills and knowledge pertaining to reflection and facilitation. He will learn a variety of tools and strategies as well as participate in various platforms such as seminars and conferences hosted by schools and NGOs. The opportunities are both exciting and demanding. Interested students should consider their motivations carefully.</p>
