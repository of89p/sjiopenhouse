                    CAS enables students to enhance their personal and interpersonal development as well as their social and civic development, through experiential learning in the following three strands: creative, activity and service. CAS experiences should be both challenging and enjoyable - a personal journey of self-discovery that recognizes each student's individual starting point. These experiences are:
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>real, purposeful activities, with significant outcomes</li>
                        <li>tasks that extend the student and be achievable in scope</li>
                        <li>thoughtfully considered involving planning, reviewing progress and reporting</li>
                        <li>reflected upon focusing on outcomes and personal learning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    Students must demonstrate satisfactory participation in CAS for the award of the IB Diploma. This is achieved through the student’s active and balanced engagement in the experiences that encompass the three strands: creativity, action and service, and through their reflections. that indicate they have fulfilled the seven CAS learning outcomes.

                                In the Astronomy Club, we focus on expanding our knowledge about the vast cosmos. We do so by coming together and collaborating with one another, discussing concepts and findings. Typical sessions include presentations and quizzes to deepen our members’ understanding of astronomy. On special occasions, we would invite external speakers to address us, exposing us to more knowledge about the physical universe and celestial objects. We also hold stargazing sessions at Singapore Botanic Gardens in the evening during which we apply skills that we have learnt.

Members are able to wholeheartedly enjoy creating music while working together with their peers in bringing a musical arrangement to live. During the COVID-19 period, practices were conducted online through zoom meetings each week, allowing members to continue practicing their instruments and improving their technique and skills.

                                The Society of International and Current Affairs focuses on discussing international issues and broadening members' global perspectives. We undergo training and participate in various Model United Nations (MUN) conferences where students act as a delegate for a country and gather in a council to discuss solutions for a global issue. The aim of a MUN is to develop universally acceptable proposals to solve some of the pressing global issues including poverty, health, energy and education, conflict, wildlife and conservation, climate change and imbalanced trade, among others.

Through Ukulele, we learn many different skills that help nurture us as a Josephian. Although 2021 had led us to move learning online, it did not stop us from continuing with our ukulele sessions. We used zoom as our main platform to resume practice with each member learning new chords and songs. Despite the challenges, we still enjoyed learning the ukulele together.

No prior art experience is necessary to join the Visual Arts Club. Visual Arts Club provides students the freedom to choose the art medium they would like to learn be it pottery, mixed media or the digital art. Most of our members have not tried any forms of art before and this is completely fine! Most students learn and pickup new skills along the way.

                In SJI, to LEAD means to SERVE. Student leaders are developed to know how to share their vision, enable their team members, be responsive to changes, be values-centred and always be encouraging to those whom they lead and work with.
                <br><br>
                We recognize that every student has the potential to lead. The school provides a wide range of opportunities for our students to exercise leadership.
                <br><br>
                Our students are provided with training during the different academic years to enable them to be effective in their leadership role.
                <br><br>
                Every student is expected to be an agent for the transmission of the Lasallian values of Faith, Service and Community to his/her fellow Josephians. They are encouraged to serve and lead others to add value to our school community, society, their friends and families and ourselves. They take a holistic approach to work, promotes a sense of community and share responsibility in decision-making.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
                St John Baptist de La Salle, the founder of the Lasallian schools, renounced his wealth and status to devote himself to setting up schools that provide the poor with access to education. He believed that with education, the poor might have lives of dignity and freedom; it gave hope and opportunity for the common good.
                <br><br>
                It is from this tradition that SJI has borne leaders who contribute to the common good. Our alumni serve in fields ranging from academia to business and the cultural arts; in social, religious and political domains.
                <br><br>
                In the same spirit, the DSA leadership programme aims to raise national (civil and political) and community (civic) leaders who serve for the common good.
                <br><br>
                Through the DSA-Leadership programme, the boy develops an awareness of self, maturing through reflection, and consequently being able to lead himself and others. A Josephian leader is a community builder who is people-centred. An effective leader is one who has to learn how to motivate and work with a team to serve the community.
                <br><br>
                Ultimately, the Josephian grows to become a servant leader for the common good. Students in this programme are expected to serve above and beyond others. This requires one to balance academic and CCA demands as well. At upper secondary, these boys will have opportunities to go out and gain leadership exposure through various community platforms. Time will be a precious resource that they need to manage well. The boys will be equipped with skills and knowledge pertaining to reflection and facilitation. He will learn a variety of tools and strategies as well as participate in various platforms such as seminars and conferences hosted by schools and NGOs. The opportunities are both exciting and demanding. Interested students should consider their motivations carefully.</p>
